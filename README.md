# Mail Marvel

## Description
Mail Marvel is an AI-powered email management tool that filters out important emails that may have been buried under less significant ones. The application classifies these important emails, allowing users to prioritize their inbox effectively and schedule their time better.

## Inspiration
The idea for Mail Marvel came from the overwhelming number of emails that users receive daily, leading to important messages getting lost in the clutter. We wanted to create a solution that helps users regain control of their inboxes.

## What it does
- Filters and classifies important emails based on user-defined criteria.
- Provides an organized schedule of important emails to help users prioritize tasks.
- Uses AI to improve filtering accuracy over time.

## Built with
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Frontend**: Streamlit for building the user interface
  - **Backend**: Flask (if applicable) or any other relevant framework
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Platform (for hosting services, if used)
- **APIs**: 
  - Gmail API for accessing and managing emails
  - OpenAI API for natural language processing and classification
- **Databases**: 
  - SQLite or PostgreSQL (depending on your choice) for storing user data and classifications
- **Libraries**:
  - Langchain for handling language models
  - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - Plotly for visualizations (if applicable)
